# VMC - Virtual Multi Cache
A Virtual Multi Cache is a type of [geocache](https://geocaching.com) that is solved like a puzzle, but includes an immersive experience in which the user explores a virtual world, similar to the experience of completing a multi-cache in the real world.

Despite being created using a VR framework, these VMCs are not intended to be viewed in VR mode; only from a laptop or PC.
Controls configuration is Minecraft style.

Inside the folders in this repository you will find examples of VMCs I have created. If you are in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, you might come across the cache listings on [geocaching.com](https://geocaching.com).
