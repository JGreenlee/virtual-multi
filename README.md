# VMC - Virtual Multi Cache
A simple virtual forest created in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) with 4 hidden treasures that each serve as a virtual stage of a multi geocache.

Despite being created using a VR framework, the forest is not intended to be viewed in VR mode; only from a laptop or PC.
Controls configuration is Minecraft style.

Low-poly 3D models created by me using Sketchup Make 2017 (freeware), exported in COLLADA (.dae) format.
